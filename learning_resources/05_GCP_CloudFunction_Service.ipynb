With Cloud Functions you write single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services. **Your function is triggered when an event being watched is fired**. Listen and respond to a file upload to Cloud Storage, a log change, or an incoming message on a Pub/Sub topic.\n",

        "\n",
        "**You can write Cloud Functions using a number of supported programming languages**. You can take your function and run it in any standard runtime environment for one of the supported languages, which makes both portability and local testing a breeze."
